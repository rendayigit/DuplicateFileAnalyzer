## üí° Tips for Best Results

### For Large Datasets

- Start with file type filters to focus your scan
- Consider scanning smaller directories first to get familiar with the interface

### Before Deleting Files

- Always review the duplicate groups carefully
- Keep the original file (usually the first one in each group)
- Consider backing up important files before deletion
- Use the "Show in Folder" option to verify file locations

### Performance Optimization

- Close other resource-intensive applications during scanning
- For external drives, ensure stable USB/connection
- The application automatically optimizes performance based on your system

## üîß Settings & Customization

Access the Settings dialog to customize:

- **Performance settings**: Adjust chunk sizes for optimal speed
- **Interface preferences**: Choose between light/dark themes
- **Auto-save options**: Automatically save scan results

The application works with all major file systems:

- **Windows**: NTFS, FAT32, exFAT
- **macOS**: APFS, HFS+
- **Linux**: ext4, ext3, XFS, Btrfs

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Slow scanning**: Try using file type filters to reduce the scope
- **Application not responding**: Large scans can take time - check the progress bar
- **Permission errors**: Run as administrator/sudo for system directories
- **Out of memory**: Scan smaller directories or restart the application

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that you have sufficient permissions for the directories you're scanning
2. Ensure you have enough free RAM for large scan operations
3. Try scanning a smaller test directory first
4. Restart the application if it becomes unresponsive
